	<p>Hmm, have so many favorite memories with you but probably the best is when I was so nervous at my wedding to walk down the aisle and you calmed me down by telling me that the priest looked like mr. bean. and then the best time ever was the limo ride from the church to the hotel drinking champagne and laughing..love you!</p>

	<p><b>Favorite moment with the bride?</b></p>
	<p>I have so (so so so) many memories with my best friend, but my all time favorite moment has to be the first day we met (as cliche as that sounds) but I absolutely love our story. It was summer going into our first year of college and we were at Freshman orientation. I saw this stunning girl with her mom and dad and KNEW I had to be friends with her. We were originally paired up with different girls for the weekend, but Shanny and I got to talking and we knew we had to spend the weekend together. We politely told our original roommates that Shannon and I would be sharing a room for the rest of the weekend and the rest is history. We went out that night and the time of our lives - now 9 years later I have not only a best friend who I adore, but a sister for life. I love everything about Shannon and she is so special to me. We have such a special bond that I cherish each and everyday. I am thrilled that she found Chris, whom I also adore and love, to spend the rest of her life with. They make an amazing couple and I couldn't be happier for the two of them! xx</p>

	<p><b>Favorite moment with the bride?</b></p>
	<p>When Shannon asked me to be part of her special day, I couldn't help to think of all of the amazing, and cherished (and wild) times that we have shared since we met at Irish Dance class in 1998..Whether it was spending hours at the studio practicing for our next competition or sneaking into bars underage; creating beautiful dance choreography & teaching the "little ones", partying like rock stars in Europe; Jigging our hearts out as the Lead Dancers for Black 47, and surviving the distance that college & work has brought us, at the end of the day, we can certainly say, we have been through everything;the good, bad, ugly, and down right embarrassing. We've seen boys come and go, hard work go a long way; we've seen disappointment sting like a bitch, and things not go exactly as planned.We could certainly write an entertaining story of two blondes (one natural, one not so much), taking on the world, one class, one beer at a time. (Maybe several on occasion).
To friendship, adventures, and the memories they bring! Slainte to the Bride and Groom!!!</p>

	<p>Putting on shows for hours for our poor family, one very famously known as "Angry Sisters", also there is another moment I can't say... But That one Christmas way back when. And if I could choose a third it would be the night I was given the nickname "Smashley" at another infamous fun Vesik party haha.</p>

	<p class="moment">Watching Super Bowl XXXIX with Bishop. His Philadelphia Eagles against my New England Patriots. We had a bell we would ring every time our team did something awesome. It was pretty intense to watch but lots of fun! My Pats came out on top that day but Bishop got his revenge when the NY Giants (his second team) ruined the Pats perfect season a couple years later.</p>
